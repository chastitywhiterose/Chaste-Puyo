SDL Chaste Puyo
Also known as Chaste Puyo: SDL_Renderer

This project is a port of a previous game I made using Raylib. It is a clone of the popular Japanese puzzle game: Puyo Puyo. SDL allows me greater control over the game loop than I knew how to do in Raylib and so I decided to rewrite the project.

This version and the original were both initially created by copying and rewriting several functions in my previous game: Chaste Tris. The game is close enough that some functions did not need modification.

To support my programming work, please buy the original version on either Steam or itch.io

You can also become my patron and support my programming work financially. In return you'll get access to the latest things I am working on that may never be published if I don't get some feedback on them.

In the future I hope to write a more detailed guide on the controls and how to play it. But really all you need to know to get started is:

WASD or arrow keys move the block
Z and X rotate it
and C holds the block for later use. It can be swapped infinite times with the current block.

The game also has the ability to save and load at any point in time. Press I to save and P to load.

You can email me with any questions or give me a comment at the sites previously mentioned.

This folder has the source code written in C using Raylib. None of the compilation has changed since copying the files from Chaste Tris.

Since this is a clone of Chaste Tris, all controls are the same. Most notably rotation is done with Z and X.
Arrow keys or WASD for movement.

Oddly enough, the hold feature from Tetris is also still available from Chaste Tris by pressing C. This violates Puyo Puyo rules but there is nothing to stop you from it.

Saving and loading with . and , is also still allowed. This means building up extreme chains is possible because mistakes can be fixed.

Updates:

February 20 2023: Added music to Chaste Puyo and also multiple savestates.


Chaste Puyo Music License

The only thing in Chaste Puyo that is not my creation is the music which was obtained freely from OverClocked ReMix.

According to my understanding of the terms in the FAQ I am allowed to use the songs as long as I give credit to OC Remix and the artists. As such, I intend to mention them in every video I create showing the gameplay with the newly added music. In fact, if I have not included credit anywhere it is most likely a technical limitation such as Tiktok or Instagram not allowing me to add long descriptions. But where possible I will give credit to the artists and OC ReMix.

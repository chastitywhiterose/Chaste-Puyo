Chaste Puyo Music License

The only thing in Chaste Puyo that is not my creation is the music which was obtained freely from OverClocked ReMix.

According to my understanding of the terms in the FAQ I am allowed to use the songs as long as I give credit to OC Remix and the artists. As such, I intend to mention them in every video I create showing the gameplay with the newly added music. In fact, if I have not included credit anywhere it is most likely a technical limitation such as Tiktok or Instagram not allowing me to add long descriptions. But where possible I will give credit to the artists and OC ReMix.
